Watch Mode (with pytest-watch) pip install pytest-watch ptw Test Fixtures The test suite uses pytest fixtures defined in tests/conftest.py : temp_dir : Temporary directory for test files mkdocs_config : Minimal MkDocs configuration mock_page : Mock page object theme_dir : Path to theme directory template_env : Jinja2 environment for templates modules_dir : Path to modules directory assets_dir : Path to assets directory Writing New Tests When adding new features, follow these guidelines: Create test files following the naming convention: test_*.py Use descriptive test names : test_feature_name_behavior Use fixtures from conftest.py when possible Keep tests focused : Each test should verify one specific behavior Add docstrings : Document what each test verifies Example: def test_new_feature_works(theme_dir): \"\"\"Test that new feature works correctly.\"\"\" feature_file = theme_dir / 'new_feature.html' assert feature_file.exists() # ... more assertions Continuous Integration Tests are automatically run via GitHub Actions on: Every push to main , develop , master , and pypi branches Every pull request targeting these branches Manual triggers via workflow_dispatch As a dependency before package publication CI Test Matrix The CI pipeline tests the project across multiple Python versions: Python 3.9 Python 3.10 Python 3.11 Python 3.12 Python 3.13 Python 3.14 CI Workflow Features Automatic dependency caching for faster builds Coverage reports generated for each run Test summaries available in GitHub Actions Parallel execution across Python versions See .github/workflows/test.yml for the complete CI configuration. Test Coverage Current test coverage includes: \u2705 Theme configuration validation \u2705 Template rendering \u2705 Module structure \u2705 Asset files \u2705 Package metadata Troubleshooting Import Errors If you encounter import errors, ensure all dependencies are installed: pip install -e \".[dev]\" Template Rendering Errors Template tests require proper Jinja2 environment setup. The template_env fixture handles this automatically. Missing Files If tests fail due to missing files, ensure you're running tests from the project root directory.
